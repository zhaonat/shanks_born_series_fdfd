### Shanks Transformation for vector series
In practical situations, the scalar epsilon-wynn algorithm can exhibit numerical stabilities when applied to a vector series. The primary way to combat this is to formally write the epsilon-wynn algorithm for a vector series, motivating the Vector Epsilon Algorithm (VEA) and the Topological Epsilon Algorithm (TEA)
